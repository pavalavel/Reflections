1) Staging area enables one to be choosy about what need to be commited.

2)Before adding to the stage, we can check the modified files usig "git status"
which allows to decide what stage and commit.

3)The branches allows the developer to take maximum risk and modify the code. 
because this is not really going to affect the main or the master branch.
