How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It really helps in saving time to find where the error exist.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to entire history of a file helps in case if i want to switch
    back to the earlier version which i may not remember on my own.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: Having a control over committing on flexible time.
    cons: I might just forget to commit and keep working on the files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Many a times developers work on multiple files which depends on each other 
    to work properly. Therefore it makes more sense to commit mutiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It's quite useful to spot the changes in the different file commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could confidently make changes because i can use git to spot the changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to try git to clone the repository, find the difference in two files
     using diff and checkout the older version of the file.
